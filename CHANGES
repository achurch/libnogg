Version 1.4
-----------
- BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The malloc() callback function now
  takes an additional parameter indicating the required address
  alignment for the allocation.
- Fixed failure to decode streams containing single-symbol codebooks.
  Note that while the reference encoder does not generate such
  codebooks, the reference decoder (as of libvorbis 1.3.4) does not
  follow the Vorbis specification with regard to them, and consequently
  any streams which do contain such codebooks and which decode correctly
  using the (buggy) reference decoder may not decode correctly with
  this library.
- Fixed incorrect decoding of monaural streams using residue type 2.
- Fixed low timing resolution in nogg-benchmark on Apple platforms.

Version 1.3 (2014/9/10)
-----------
- Fixed identifier shadowing warnings when building with old versions of
  GCC.

Version 1.2 (2014/8/3)
-----------
- Fixed "make install" failure when BUILD_TOOLS was enabled.

Version 1.1 (2014/7/6)
-----------
- Renamed internal symbols to avoid conflicts with client code.

Version 1.0 (2014/7/6)
-----------
- Initial release.
