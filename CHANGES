Version 1.15
------------
- Added build rules for the Microsoft Visual C compiler to the Makefile.
  See the README file for limitations.

Version 1.14 (2019/8/27)
------------
- Added a packet-mode interface (vorbis_open_packet()) for decoding
  Vorbis streams not embedded in Ogg containers.
- vorbis_read_float() now returns the new error code
  VORBIS_ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION instead of INVALID_ARGUMENT when called
  on a decoder created with the READ_INT16_ONLY option.
- Fixed decoding errors from SIMD-optimized code when building for x86
  using recent versions of GCC and -ffast-math.

Version 1.13 (2019/8/21)
------------
- No functional changes.
- Removed reference to Bitbucket in documentation, since Bitbucket is
  dropping Mercurial support.

Version 1.12 (2019/3/1)
------------
- Improved seek performance.
- Fixed a bug which could cause inaccurate seeks in streams with
  non-audio packets interleaved into the stream.

Version 1.11 (2017/11/17)
------------
- Fixed several cases discovered by the afl-fuzz tool in which malformed
  input could cause crashes or memory corruption.
- Fixed C99 noncompliance in compiler test macros.

Version 1.10 (2017/6/3)
------------
- Fixed unintentional GCC-specific function attributes.
- Fixed parameter attribute mismatches on internal functions.

Version 1.9 (2016/3/29)
-----------
- Added vorbis_bitrate().
- Changed vorbis_rate() to return an unsigned value, to match the Vorbis
  specification.
- Fixed inaccurate vorbis_channels() and vorbis_rate() documentation to
  reflect that the functions always return positive values.

Version 1.8 (2015/12/24)
-----------
- Refactored code to address false-positive Coverity defects (no change
  in behavior).

Version 1.7 (2015/2/28)
-----------
- Fixed a compilation error occurring when compiling the library for
  64-bit ARM using GCC.

Version 1.6 (2015/2/27)
-----------
- Updated the decoder logic for errata 20150226 to the Vorbis
  specification, related to streams containing codebooks with only one
  used symbol.  Previously, the specification and reference decoder
  implementation differed in their handling of such codebooks; libnogg
  followed the specification (after related fixes in version 1.4), and
  consequently failed to decode some streams which the reference decoder
  was able to successfully decode.  The errata modifies the
  specification to conform to the behavior of the reference decoder in
  such cases, and thus libnogg can now decode such streams.
  (Conversely, streams which conformed to the pre-errata specification
  can no longer be decoded correctly, though no such streams are known
  to exist "in the wild".)
- Fixed crash when decoding zero-length streams.
- Removed declaration of nonexistent vorbis_set_options() function.
- Moved internal headers out of the "include" directory.

Version 1.5 (2015/1/12)
-----------
- Fixed duplicate "const" in variable declarations.

Version 1.4 (2015/1/3)
-----------
- BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The malloc() callback function now
  takes an additional parameter indicating the required address
  alignment for the allocation.
- Fixed failure to decode streams containing single-symbol codebooks.
  Note that while the reference encoder does not generate such
  codebooks, the reference decoder (as of libvorbis 1.3.4) does not
  follow the Vorbis specification with regard to them, and consequently
  any streams which do contain such codebooks and which decode correctly
  using the (buggy) reference decoder may not decode correctly with
  this library.
- Fixed incorrect decoding of monaural streams using residue type 2.
- Fixed low timing resolution in nogg-benchmark on Apple platforms.

Version 1.3 (2014/9/10)
-----------
- Fixed identifier shadowing warnings when building with old versions of
  GCC.

Version 1.2 (2014/8/3)
-----------
- Fixed "make install" failure when BUILD_TOOLS was enabled.

Version 1.1 (2014/7/6)
-----------
- Renamed internal symbols to avoid conflicts with client code.

Version 1.0 (2014/7/6)
-----------
- Initial release.
