Version 1.6 (2015/2/27)
-----------
- Updated the decoder logic for errata 20150226 to the Vorbis
  specification, related to streams containing codebooks with only one
  used symbol.  Previously, the specification and reference decoder
  implementation differed in their handling of such codebooks; libnogg
  followed the specification (after related fixes in version 1.4), and
  consequently failed to decode some streams which the reference decoder
  was able to successfully decode.  The errata modifies the
  specification to conform to the behavior of the reference decoder in
  such cases, and thus libnogg can now decode such streams.
  (Conversely, streams which conformed to the pre-errata specification
  can no longer be decoded correctly, though no such streams are known
  to exist "in the wild".)
- Fixed crash when decoding zero-length streams.
- Removed declaration of nonexistent vorbis_set_options() function.
- Moved internal headers out of the "include" directory.

Version 1.5 (2015/1/12)
-----------
- Fixed duplicate "const" in variable declarations.

Version 1.4 (2015/1/3)
-----------
- BACKWARDS-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: The malloc() callback function now
  takes an additional parameter indicating the required address
  alignment for the allocation.
- Fixed failure to decode streams containing single-symbol codebooks.
  Note that while the reference encoder does not generate such
  codebooks, the reference decoder (as of libvorbis 1.3.4) does not
  follow the Vorbis specification with regard to them, and consequently
  any streams which do contain such codebooks and which decode correctly
  using the (buggy) reference decoder may not decode correctly with
  this library.
- Fixed incorrect decoding of monaural streams using residue type 2.
- Fixed low timing resolution in nogg-benchmark on Apple platforms.

Version 1.3 (2014/9/10)
-----------
- Fixed identifier shadowing warnings when building with old versions of
  GCC.

Version 1.2 (2014/8/3)
-----------
- Fixed "make install" failure when BUILD_TOOLS was enabled.

Version 1.1 (2014/7/6)
-----------
- Renamed internal symbols to avoid conflicts with client code.

Version 1.0 (2014/7/6)
-----------
- Initial release.
