Version: 0.1


Overview
--------
libnogg is a library for decoding Ogg Vorbis audio streams, written with
the primary aim of improved code quality and robustness compared to the
reference libogg and libvorbis libraries, and with a secondary aim of
improved performance compared to those libraries.

libnogg is based on the public domain stb_vorbis implementation,
available as of this writing at <http://nothings.org/stb_vorbis/>.


Requirements
------------
libnogg is written in pure C99 and should compile with any standards-
compliant compiler.  The included Makefile is written for GNU Make and
supports building with Clang, GCC, or the Intel compiler.


Building
--------
libnogg can be built by simply running the "make" command (or "gmake",
if GNU Make is installed under that name on your system) in the top
directory of the libnogg distribution.  This will create shared and
static library files in the top directory, which can then be installed
on the system with "make install".

Several configuration variables are available to control the build
process or specify nonstandard paths for dependent libraries.  These can
be set on the "make" command line; for example, "make BUILD_FRONTEND=1".
See the "Configuration" section at the top of the "Makefile" file for
details.


Using libnogg
-------------
The file "src/sample.c" demonstrates how libnogg can be used to decode
audio data from an Ogg Vorbis stream.

See the documentation in nogg.h for further details.


Caveats
-------
Currently, libnogg has the following limitations:
   - The library cannot decode multiple bitstreams from a single file.
   - Lossless deletion of samples from the front of the stream (negative
     initial sample position) is not supported.
