    tests/data/sketch039.ogg
    tests/data/thingy.ogg

The first three files were downloaded from
<http://nothings.org/stb_vorbis/samples/> for use as test data; the last
two files were generated from the corresponding stb_vorbis sample files
by re-encoding them using version 1.0 beta 4 of the reference encoder.
